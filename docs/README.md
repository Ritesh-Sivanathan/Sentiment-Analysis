# Sentiment Analyzer - Airline Tweets

## Overview

Some project I made like 2 or 3 months ago, just found it in a random directory on my machine <br>
Just trained on a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment"> Kaggle dataset </a> containing a csv with random tweets to airlines or 
something like that <br>

I think this was like a week or two after i started learning about nns, tf, keras and all that good stuff, so it was definitely a learning experience <br>
